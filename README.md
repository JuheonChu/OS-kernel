# Operating System Kernel
Built up our own operating system conducted by a group of John Chu, Amir Zawad, and Adia Wu for Spring 2022 semester. 
For Dickinson College Comp 354 Operating System class, we performed a kernel project to enable our operating system functions like a real-world operating system capable of the following commands at shell:

1. type <file>
2. copy <src file> <dest file>
3. delete <file>
4. dir
5. execute <prog>
